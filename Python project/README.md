# Deciding which mobile app to develop based on a data-driven approach

### Project overview

I worked on this project for the Data Analysis online Master and it represented my first application of Python with a real-looking dataset.
I played the part of a developer who wants to launch a new mobile app, but first wants to identify which type of app has more chances of being successful based on the existing apps in the Google Play store.
As a starting point I cleaned the dataset (changed column file types when required, removed duplicates, excluded data that was not useful etc.), then went through some exploratory data analysis that led me to gather several insights that I should take into account before developing a new app.  

### Data sources

A Google Play Store dataset in csv format downloaded from Kaggle
