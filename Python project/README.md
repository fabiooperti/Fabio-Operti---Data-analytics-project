# Deciding which mobile app to develop based on a data-driven approach

### Project overview

This project was part of my Data Analysis online Master and marks my first practical application of Python using a real-looking dataset. The goal was to simulate the role of a developer aiming to launch a new mobile app. The objective was to identify the type of app with the highest potential for success by analyzing existing apps on the Google Play Store.

I began by cleaning the dataset, which involved for instance changing column data types, removing duplicates, and excluding irrelevant data. Following this, I performed exploratory data analysis to uncover key insights that would inform the development of a new app. 

### Data sources

The dataset used in this project is the Google Play Store dataset, which was downloaded in CSV format from Kaggle.

### Tools used and supporting files

- Jupyter Notebook - An interactive workspace for working with Python and its libraries in a notebook format 
My Python code, along with explanatory comments, can be viewed in the Jupyter Notebook. The final considerations based on the analysis are available at the end of the notebook.

(Please allow approximately 30 seconds for the notebook to load)

- Python libraries used in the notebook: 
  - Pandas: for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn: for plotting charts
