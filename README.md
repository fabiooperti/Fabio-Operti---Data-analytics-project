# **Welcome to my Data Analysis and Visualization Portfolio**

I am Fabio Operti, a Controlling professional and a lifelong learner, with a strong commitment to develop my data analysis and visualization skills.

In 2023 I have attended an online Master in Data Analysis in parallel with my full-time daily job, which helped me develop a good base in skills like 
**SQL** (a structured language to query and analyze data from databases), **Python** (one of the most common programming language used in this space) and 
**Tableau** (a Business Intelligence visualization tool).

This repository showcases my journey and projects and it's a work in progress, as my knowledge of these skills continues to improve.
