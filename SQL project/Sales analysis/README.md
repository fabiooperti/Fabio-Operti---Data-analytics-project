# Sales analysis with dummy database

### Project overview

I used a dummy database of an hypotetical company selling vitamins and integrators to analyse its sales.
It represents a relatively simple exploratory analysis of the data distributed over 5 separate tables, to put into practice my SQL learning.

### Data sources

Dummy database of a company distributed over 5 separate tables. The datase can be reviewed [here](https://github.com/fabiooperti/Fabio-Operti---Data-analytics-project/blob/main/SQL%20project/Sales%20analysis/Sales%20database.ods)

### Tools used and supporting files

- **Github Codespaces** - To query against the Sales database and visualize the results
- The purpose of each query, the codes and the output of the queries can be found [here](https://github.com/fabiooperti/Fabio-Operti---Data-analytics-project/blob/main/SQL%20project/Sales%20analysis/SQL%20scripts.md)
