# Sales analysis with dummy database

### Project overview

I used a dummy database of an hypotetical company selling vitamins and integrators to analyse its sales.
It represents a relatively simple exploratory analysis of the data distributed over 5 separate tables, to put into practice my SQL learning.

### Data sources
