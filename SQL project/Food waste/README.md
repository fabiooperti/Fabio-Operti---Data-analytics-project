# Food waste analysis with FAO dataset

### Project overview

I used the dataset of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to perform an analysis about food waste.
It represents a relatively simple exploratory analysis of the data, to put into practice my SQL learning.

### Data sources

FAO dataset on global food waste from 1965 to 2021. The datase can be downloaded from the FAO website.
